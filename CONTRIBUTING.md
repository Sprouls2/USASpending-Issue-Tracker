# USASpending.gov Issue Tracker Community Guidelines 

Thank you for taking the time to report your issue. To get started, click the green “new issue” button. When reporting an issue, please keep the following in mind:

- Check existing issues first. Look through the open and closed issues to see if what you’re experiencing has been addressed already.
- Please be clear about the issue you’re experiencing: what was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
- Include a screenshot of the issue.
- Include system details like the browser, library or operating system you’re using and its version.
- Add a label to your issue. You can see the full list if you click the “labels” header in the top right section of the screen. Pick one or more labels that describe your issue, such as “Documentation”, “Bug”, or “Question”. 
- Paste error output or logs in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ``` so that it renders nicely.

For more information on how reporting issues in Github works, check out this [Issues guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

This is intended to be a productive forum for resolving issues and requesting improvements. Issues that meet the following criteria will be removed by staff:

- Ad hominem or personal attacks on users, profanity, aggressive behavior, or instigating arguments in a disrespectful manner
- Repeated posting of identical or very similar content in a counter-productive way,
- Posts that do not primarily concern the technical operation of the site – this includes posts aggressively promoting services or products.

We retain the discretion to determine which issues violate our guidelines. We also reserve the right to remove violations. We expect all contributors to be respectful.
