In our continuing efforts to improve USAspending, we are providing the delta archive sample files below for your testing and validation.

Please review the important notes and testing procedures below before beginning.

**Important Notes:**

1. The sample files are only in csv and tsv formats.  Xml and ATOM feeds will be available once the files are posted on USAspending.gov.
2. The data provided is for preview testing of the Delta files and is not meant for production use.
3. The files will be available for preview testing through Thursday May 14th, 2015. We request the community to provide feedback about urgent or critical issues by Monday, May 11th 2015 so that they can be considered by the development team for review to incorporate for the file generation scheduled for May 16th 2015. Comments received after Monday, May 11, 2015 will be reviewed and considered depending on the nature of the comment in subsequent releases.
4. Users of the sample Delta files will notice a few minor changes with regard to content and data formatting. Specific examples include:
    1. Use of Capitalization of the field values instead of having the first letter as upper case with remaining in lower case e.g. a value of NO instead of No.
    2. Blank field values instead of 0â€™s in the exec_amount fields.
    3. Change in standardized values that follow the source system data dictionary for certain fields such as contractactiontype. Also In the non-Contracts data, the principal_place_state column sometimes comes with countries, whereas now it always has the State code value.
